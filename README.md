<h1>Stopwatch JavaScript Project</h1>
<p>This project is a web-based stopwatch and countdown timer application that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can utilize both a forward-counting stopwatch and a countdown timer that counts down from a specific minute, all within the same interface. Additionally, I have incorporated features to adjust the speed of the forward count and to set the starting minute for the countdown.
